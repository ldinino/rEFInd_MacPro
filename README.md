# rEFInd_MacPro
A copy of rEFInd with a config file that sets VMX to true, enabling virtualization features on 6,1 2013 Mac Pro "Trash Can" models.

This is literally just rEFInd downloaded straight from https://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/

Instead of a sample config, I renamed the config file and changed one line, uncommenting `enable_and_lock_vmx` and setting it to true.
